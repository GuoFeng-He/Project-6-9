-----------------------------
Humanity has been taken over. A virus? Parasite? It's still unclear. Research has been ongoing for approximately
[REDACTED] system hours. We might be stumbling upon a breakthrough! Taking the cells of a [REDACTED] and combining it
with the cells of a [REDACTED] yields a substance, a vaccine if you will, that could be humanity's saving grace.
We are now undergoing testing of the substance on Subjects 451, 681, and 343. They had each taken a shot of the
substance. Screening shows lifting of symptoms and gradual restoration of their health and sanity.
Further updates will be posted.
